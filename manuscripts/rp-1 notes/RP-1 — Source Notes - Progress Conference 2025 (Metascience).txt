RP-1 — Source Notes

## Progress Conference 2025 & the Rise of Metascience

> **Role of this note**: Canonical *source-derived* reference for RP‑1. This document captures **external signals, claims, and tensions** from the Progress Conference 2025 (as reported by Big Think), separated from strategy synthesis.

---

## 1. What Metascience Looks Like *in Practice* (2025)

Metascience has moved from critique to construction. The ecosystem is actively building:

* new research organizations
* new funding mechanisms
* new definitions of scientific output

The emphasis is no longer on reforming peer review or publishing norms, but on **re‑architecting the entire production stack of science**.

---

## 2. Dataset‑First Science

A core shift highlighted at the conference:

> **Datasets, not papers, are becoming the primary scientific artifact.**

Key ideas:

* Preserve biological complexity instead of simplifying it for human comprehension.
* Store noise, failed experiments, background measurements, and lab context.
* Design datasets that are *AI‑native*, not human‑curated summaries.

Example direction:

* “Protein Data Bank 2.0” — richer, messier, more complete biological records intended for machine reasoning.

Implication:

* Reproducibility emerges from *process transparency*, not post‑hoc statistical policing.

---

## 3. AI as a Scientific Operator

AI is framed not as a tool but as a **participant** in research workflows:

* hypothesis generation
* experiment prioritization
* pattern discovery across noisy biological data

This reframes scientists as **system designers**, not just analysts.

---

## 4. Focused Research Organizations (FROs)

FROs address a structural gap:

* Projects too large, infrastructural, or engineering‑heavy for academia
* Too long‑horizon or uncertain for venture‑backed industry

Characteristics:

* mission‑locked
* milestone‑driven
* team‑based (not PI‑centric)

Goal:

* Build *trunks of the technology tree* that downstream research can build upon.

---

## 5. New Funding Logic

Traditional grant systems are viewed as:

* conservative
* proposal‑heavy
* hostile to infrastructure and long‑term bets

Alternatives discussed:

* pull‑based funding (pay for outcomes)
* flexible agencies (e.g., ARIA‑style)
* long‑horizon endowments (speculative, unresolved)

Open tension:

* Outcome‑based funding risks undervaluing curiosity‑driven, exploratory science.

---

## 6. Unresolved Risks & Critiques

Despite optimism, key concerns remain:

* Will infrastructure‑centric science crowd out conceptual breakthroughs?
* Can milestone logic coexist with genuine uncertainty?
* Who funds science when goals cannot be specified in advance?

These are open design problems, not settled conclusions.

---

## 7. Why This Matters for RP‑1

This source establishes the **external rationale** for RP‑1 design choices:

* emphasis on datasets over publications
* reproducibility as a first‑class output
* portfolio‑style execution instead of single papers
* alignment with post‑academic research models

This note should be treated as **evidence of landscape awareness**, not strategy.

---

## 8. Relationship to Other RP‑1 Notes

* **RP‑1 — Metascience, Strategy, and Execution Notes** → *internal synthesis & positioning*
* **This document** → *external signal capture & grounding*

Do not merge. Separation preserves epistemic clarity.
