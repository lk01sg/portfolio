RP-1 — Metascience, Strategy, and Execution Notes

> **Context**: Research Project #1 (RP-1) — positioning an AI‑first, data‑centric scientific portfolio aligned with global metascience trends (Progress Conference 2025).

---

## 1. Executive Summary

Metascience is no longer commentary; it is infrastructure. The frontier has shifted from papers to **datasets, pipelines, and organizations**. AI‑native workflows, alternative funding, and Focused Research Organizations (FROs) redefine how impactful science is built. RP‑1 is designed to exploit this shift with asymmetric leverage: **unique data + reproducible pipelines + clear milestones**.

---

## 2. Core Metascience Principles (2025)

* **Dataset‑first science**: Data + metadata + notebooks are primary outputs; papers are derivatives.
* **AI‑native research**: Preserve complexity (noise included); let models extract structure.
* **Reproducibility by default**: Open lab books, versioned pipelines, transparent decisions.
* **Org innovation**: FROs fill the gap between academia and industry for medium‑scale, engineering‑heavy science.
* **Outcome‑driven funding**: Milestones > proposals; pull‑funding and flexible capital rise.

## 3. Asia‑Pacific Advantage

Asia should not imitate; it should leapfrog.

**Structural edges**:

* Unique domains: biodiversity, tropical disease, pharmacogenomics of Asian populations.
* Lower costs: viable AI + low‑cost wetlab hybrids.
* Faster iteration: fewer legacy constraints.

**Strategic play**: Own data niches others cannot replicate.

---

## 4. RP‑1 Strategic Focus

**North Star**: Build a small but irreplaceable open dataset + end‑to‑end pipeline that demonstrates AI‑first, reproducible science.

**Candidate themes** (pick one):

* Network pharmacology of tropical medicinal plants.
* Immune‑dynamics modeling for dengue/malaria.
* AI‑first protein structure workflows on tropical proteomes.
* Metabolomics + systems biology for herbal drugs.

---

## 5. Deliverables (Non‑Negotiable)

* **Open Dataset v1** (small, unique, well‑annotated).
* **Reproducible Pipeline** (Quarto + GitHub): data → analysis → figures.
* **Open Lab Book**: decisions, failures, assumptions.
* **Executable Milestones**: clear progress checkpoints.

---

## 6. 6–12 Month Execution Plan

**Months 1–2**

* Finalize RP‑1 theme.
* Define schema + metadata standards.
* Scaffold repo (Quarto, CI, versioning).

**Months 3–5**

* Build Dataset v1.
* Implement baseline models (network analysis / docking / PK‑PD).
* Release reproducible notebook.

**Months 6–9**

* Expand dataset (v2).
* Stress‑test reproducibility.
* External feedback + iteration.

**Months 10–12**

* Package as portfolio artifact.
* Funding outreach (Emergent Ventures, Convergent Research, Schmidt Futures).
* Position for PhD applications / FRO collaboration.

---

## 7. Funding & Collaboration Targets

* **Emergent Ventures** — asymmetric ideas, small teams.
* **Convergent Research** — FRO‑style projects.
* **Schmidt Futures** — unconventional talent + AI.

Pitch with *deliverables*, not pedigree.

---

## 8. Success Criteria

* Dataset cited or reused.
* Pipeline cloned and executed by others.
* External collaborators initiate contact.
* RP‑1 clearly signals readiness for frontier PhD/FRO environments.

---

## 9. Final Thesis

> *Stop optimizing for publication. Start compounding infrastructure.*

RP‑1 is not a paper. It is a **proof‑of‑execution** in the new science economy.
