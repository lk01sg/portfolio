RP-1 — Scope, Constraints, and Non-Goals

> **Purpose**: This note explicitly defines what RP‑1 *is*, *is not*, and *will not attempt*. It exists to prevent scope creep, hype‑driven decisions, and false comparisons with industrial R&D. This document is a strategic asset, not a limitation.

---

## 1. Positioning Statement

RP‑1 is a **solo, seed‑stage research project** designed to demonstrate *architectural thinking*, *methodological clarity*, and *scale‑readiness* — **not industrial scale itself**.

RP‑1 operates as a **FRO‑seed**: a proof that a research direction is structurally sound, intellectually non‑trivial, and worth scaling by a future team or organization.

---

## 2. Explicit Scope (What RP‑1 Intentionally Does)

RP‑1 focuses on:

* **Conceptual leverage over brute force**
* **Mechanistic or network‑level insight**, not end‑to‑end product pipelines
* **Small, high‑value datasets** with deep annotation
* **Reproducible, modular pipelines** that are ready to scale
* **AI‑first reasoning**, not AI‑heavy compute

Valid research activities include:

* Network‑based modeling (drug–target–pathway, immune networks)
* Systems‑level abstractions using public or modest datasets
* Method development, benchmarking, or integration
* Transparent documentation of assumptions, failures, and trade‑offs

---

## 3. Hard Constraints (Non‑Negotiable)

These constraints are *design choices*, not deficiencies.

### 3.1 Infrastructure Constraints

* No proprietary industrial datasets
* No HPC clusters or large‑scale GPU training
* No robotic or high‑throughput wet‑lab automation

### 3.2 Resource Constraints

* Single primary researcher
* Limited compute budget
* Time‑bounded execution

These constraints enforce **intellectual discipline**.

---

## 4. Non‑Goals (What RP‑1 Explicitly Refuses to Do)

RP‑1 will **not**:

* Compete with big‑pharma AI pipelines
* Replicate industrial screening or discovery stacks
* Train foundation models from scratch
* Optimize for publication count
* Chase LLM hype without mechanistic grounding

Any task requiring:

* massive proprietary data
* continuous wet‑lab throughput
* hundreds of GPUs

is **out of scope by design**.

---

## 5. Rationale: Why These Limits Are Strategic

Attempting to mirror industry would:

* dilute intellectual signal
* introduce unmanageable dependencies
* weaken PhD‑level evaluation value

By contrast, this scope allows RP‑1 to:

* surface *new representations* and *new questions*
* remain legible to academic evaluators
* act as a blueprint for future scaling

---

## 6. Relationship to FROs and Industry

RP‑1 is **FRO‑compatible**, not FRO‑complete.

It is designed to answer:

> *“If this worked, what organization should exist to scale it?”*

—not:

> *“How do I scale this alone?”*

This distinction is intentional.

---

## 7. Evaluation Criteria

RP‑1 is successful if:

* its core idea survives critique under these constraints
* its pipeline can be reused or extended by others
* it clarifies *what scaling would require*
* it attracts interest from collaborators, not imitation attempts

---

## 8. Final Principle

> **Constraints are the architecture.**

RP‑1 treats limits as a forcing function for clarity, originality, and future relevance.
