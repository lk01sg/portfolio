# Portfolio

Welcome to my analytical portfolio and documentation site. This repository contains computational work, analytical frameworks, and documentation spanning systems biology, computational modeling, and data-driven inquiry at the intersection of life sciences and analytical methods.

---

## About This Portfolio

This site documents work in:

- **Systems Immunology**: Network-level understanding of immune responses and regulatory mechanisms
- **Systems Biology**: Integrative approaches to biological networks and pathway analysis
- **PK/PD Modeling**: Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modeling frameworks
- **Network Pharmacology**: Multi-target and systems-level drug action
- **Computational Drug Design**: Structure-based and ligand-based approaches
- **Machine Learning**: Applications to biological data with attention to interpretability and limitations
- **Metascience**: Research methodology, reproducibility, and epistemic considerations

The work emphasizes systems-level perspective, reproducible workflows, and careful interpretation of computational results in biological contexts.

## Repository Structure

The portfolio is organized to support reproducible analytical workflows:

- **`/code/`** - Analytical notebooks, reusable modules, and processing scripts
- **`/data/`** - Raw, processed, and sample datasets with clear provenance documentation
- **`/experiments/`** - Computational experiments with configs, logs, and results
- **`/literature/`** - Organized papers, books, and synthesis notes by topic
- **`/manuscripts/`** - Drafts, analytical memos, figures, and tables
- **`/presentations/`** - Materials for seminars and collaborative discussions
- **`/results/`** - Generated figures, trained models, and evaluation metrics

See the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/lk01sg/portfolio) for the complete structure and documentation.

## Methodological Approach

This portfolio reflects several core principles:

- **Long-horizon inquiry**: Focus on sustained investigation over quick iteration
- **Biological realism**: Emphasis on mechanistic understanding and model validity
- **Conceptual clarity**: Prioritizing understanding over execution speed
- **Epistemic humility**: Transparent reporting of limitations and uncertainty

The work is suited for collaborative environments that value careful interpretation, systems thinking, and science-driven decision support.
